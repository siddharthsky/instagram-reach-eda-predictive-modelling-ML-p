### About

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis and builds predictive models for estimating reach of Instagram posts.

### Dataset

The dataset contains information about 5249 Instagram posts from various influencers and businesses with features like hashtags used, captions, number of likes, comments and followers.

### EDA

Visualizing correlations between features, outlier detection, feature importance, etc.

### Predictive Modelling

Various machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting are trained and their performance is compared.
